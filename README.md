# XLX299 Dashboard

The standard XLX dashboard modified:

* relies on a [PocketBase](https://pocketbase.io/) app that monitors the XLX logfile to show realtime activity on the main page
* restyled
* additional pages (information and thanks)
* polls Peanut API to monitor users
* displays message of the day (can be dismissed)
